## About
I'm a second-year PhD student at UBC working with [Alexander J. Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) and [Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/). I'm interested in programming languages, program verification, and type theory.

Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer in [Coderrect Inc.](https://coderrect.com/) where I was the main developer of an LLVM-based static analyzer for concurrent programs. My previous research focused on static analysis, especially detecting concurrency bugs.

I got my MS in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, advised by [Jeff Huang](https://o2lab.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.Eng. from Department of Electrical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

## Misc
I was often asked how to pronounce my first name correctly. It contains 2 Chinese characters ("Yan(彦)" and "Ze(泽)") and you can find its pronunciation in Mandarin [here](https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E5%BD%A6%E6%B3%BD&op=translate). Nevertheless, **I'm happy with any reasonable pronunciation**!

I'm a huge fan of video games (although I don't have enough time playing them since I started doing research).
I love games with good story-telling (e.g., Life is Strange/Detroit: Become Human) and games with sci-fi/cyberpunk backgrounds. I sincerely hope video games can be a main stream for story-telling someday.
