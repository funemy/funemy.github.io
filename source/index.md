## About
I'm a PhD student at UBC working with [Alexander J. Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) and [Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/). I'm interested in programming languages (especially semantics, type theory, and functional programming) and program verification (especially program logics and deductive verification).

Before I started my PhD, I did my Master's in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, advised by [Jeff Huang](https://o2lab.github.io/), and then worked as a Software Engineer at Coderrect Inc. (now [Sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/)), where I led the development of a static analyzer for concurrent programs based on LLVM.

I obtained my B.Eng. at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where I studied how to produce and transmit electricity.

## Working

- **AWS, S3 Automated Reasoning Group**, Applied Scientist Intern, 2024 fall
I worked on a randomized concurrency testing tool called [Shuttle](https://github.com/awslabs/shuttle). I developed a lightweight library for annotating large codebases to measure customized state coverage when running Shuttle. I then worked on applying Reinforcement Learning to improve state coverage when doing concurrency testing.

## Misc
I was often asked how to pronounce my first name correctly. It contains 2 Chinese characters (Yan(彦) and Ze(泽)) and google translate gives a very accurate pronunciation in Mandarin ([link](https://translate.google.com/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E5%BD%A6%E6%B3%BD&op=translate)). However, **I'm happy with any reasonable pronunciation**, and you shouldn't feel obligated to pronounce it "right"! Most of my friends read it as "Yan-zee" in English.

I'm a huge fan of video games (although I don't have enough time playing them since I started doing research). I love games with good story-telling. I hope video games can be a main stream for story-telling someday.
